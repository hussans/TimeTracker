**Description**: This project is from Frontend Mentors where they provided a code file vip and a figma file to use to recreate one of their projects. In the Time Tracker, we use a json file data to display on the dashboard of the Time Tracker. There are buttons that display daily, weekly, and monthly data. This project requires HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Review**: Wow! This is very impressive. The responsivness is so smooth. There alot i can learn from your work. The only thing I would adjust is add some padding to the bottom of the page when you scale down to the mobile version.Great Work.
